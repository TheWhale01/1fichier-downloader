# 1Fichier downloader
A little python web scraper to download a list of links.
It DOES NOT bypass the waiting time and DOES NOT give full download speed.
Just a dummy little program that takes a list of links and waits between each downloads

## Requirements
 - Firefox (apt)
 - python3

## How to use it ?
1. create a links.txt file.
2. paste the 1fichier links inside
3. run `python3 download.py`
4. your downloads should be in the `${program's dir}/downloads`
